# Engineering notes

A running log of the performance, security and scalability reasoning behind each piece of code.
Entries are written in the same commit as the code they describe.

Format: what was built, what could go wrong, what was done about it.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

### Why these notes exist

Decisions that are obvious while writing code are invisible a week later, and invisible to a
reviewer reading a diff. Anything chosen for a reason — an index, a cap, an escape, a rejected
optimisation — is recorded here with the reasoning, including the optimisations deliberately
not made.

### Standing rules

**Security**

- No user input reaches SQL as a fragment. Sort columns and filter keys are whitelisted against a
  fixed allowlist; anything else is rejected, not sanitised.
- Pagination has a hard maximum. An uncapped `per_page` is a one-request dump of the whole salary
  table.
- `config.filter_parameters` covers salary amounts and email, so compensation data never reaches a
  log file or an error report.
- Any value written to CSV that begins with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` is escaped. HR opens these files
  in Excel, where an unescaped formula is code execution on their machine.

**Performance**

- No endpoint loads a full table into memory. Aggregates are computed by the database.
- Associations used by a list view are eager-loaded. Bullet runs in development to catch N+1s.
- Any index added is justified by a specific query, and the justification goes in these notes.

**Scalability**

- Where a choice is correct now but wrong at larger scale, the note records the trigger for
  changing it, not just the limitation.
